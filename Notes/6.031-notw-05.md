## 14 Recursion

* Safe from bugs: Recursive code is simpler and often uses unreassignable variables and immutable objects.
* Easy to understand: Recursive implementations for naturally recursive problems and recursive data are often shorter and easier to understand than iterative solutions.
* Ready for change: Recursive code is also naturally reentrant, which makes it safer from bugs and ready to use in more situations(concurrency).
